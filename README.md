# Attempts to add `@angular/material` to Polsyscope X 10.6.0

This repo has been forked to provide a minimal example of
the challenges we have with getting @angluar/material to work
with Polyscope X 10.6.0.

The commit history closely reflects our attempts to add material to our own
URCap. The styles are not applied, and we see the following message in the
browser console when starting up the simulator:
> Could not find Angular Material core theme. Most Material components may not work as expected. For more info refer to the theming guide: https://material.angular.io/guide/theming

Any suggestions or help is appreciated.
